    "I am a data scientist currently residing in Downtown Singapore. I currently live within walking distance to Downtown \"Singapore Flyer metro station\" therefore I have access to good public transportation to work. Likewise, I enjoy many ammenities in the neighborhood , such as international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work in Manhattan, NY. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stress toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Manhattan. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during the Coursera course to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it rewarding doing it myself with learned tools."

The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run.

The loop algorythms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius.

I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area. Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.
